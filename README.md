## Preamble üìö
the list will be compiled over time as i accumulate more resources. this is comprised of the many websites i've come across as i do my research into more learning resources. this list is my attempt to organize all of them into one location for easier access for both myself and others who want to learn how to code.

## How to Use List üîç
the list can be easily filtered through use the function `CtrL + F` (or `Cmd + F` on MacOS) to find the programming language you are looking for. some items may be able to fit in multiple categories.
